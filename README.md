# Bob's Burgers of the Day

## Description

A page that displays the individual ratings of each episode/season in Bob’s Burgers along with the name of that individual burger of the day. It will use https://www.bobsburgersapi.com/documentation#burger-of-the-day to request the title (ex- “Foot Feta-ish Burger”), price, and end credits sequence image from https://www.bobsburgersapi.com/documentation#end-credits-sequence. The ratings of each episode will be requested from https://imdb-api.com/api/#Ratings-header.

## User Story

As a Bob’s Burgers Fan
I want to filter episodes/seasons 
So that I can view the individual ratings on IMDb 
(IMDb/metacritic/theMovieDb/rottenTomatoes/filmaffinity) in unison with the individual burger of the day for each episode (title/price/end credit image).

## Usage

As you load you page you have two boxes, one on the left side and one on the right side. The box on the left has two dropdown boxes, the top one says "Choose your Season" and the bottom 
one says "Choose your Episode". The box on the right side has a short description of the show and a small picture of the bob's burger family. The user selects the season and the episode 
they want from the dropdown box. After they select that and click the go button the box on the right will show the user all the burgers of the day that were in that episode. It will also 
show the price of the burgers, the imDb rating of that episode, and a snapshot picture of the ending credit sequence. If there was no burger of the day for that episode it will show the 
user "No burger of the Day". They can select another episode using the dropdown boxes or click the burger on the top left corner to reset the page.
